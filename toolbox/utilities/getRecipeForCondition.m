% Get paths to a Toy Virutal World Recipe that we rendered on AWS.
%
% This is a utility to make it easier to find recipes, without worrying
% about how we organized our AWS jobs.
%
% This specific script, AwsRecipeForCondition2, is intended to work with
% our second production run on AWS, which I call "vwcc2".
%
% You'd need to mount our S3 bucket named "render-toolbox-vwcc2".  Here are
% some instructions for mounting on OS X:
%   https://github.com/RenderToolbox3/rtb-support/wiki/Mounting-S3-on-OS-X
%
% This function is a hack!  It contains several hard-coded values that are
% specific to our AWS jobs.  This is necessary because the file mount
% is a slow interface to S3, and we have some 10 million of files to search
% through, so regular file searching would be really slow.
%
% recipePath = AwsRecipeForCondition2(luminanceLevel, reflectanceNumber)
% searches our S3 bucket mount for the recipe that was run with the given
% luminance level and reflectance number.
%
% AwsRecipeForCondition2( ... 'bucketFolder', bucketFolder) specify the
% folder where our S3 bucket was mounted.  The default is
% '~/Desktop/render-toolbox-vwcc2'.
%
% Returns a struct of info about the recipe, if found.  This includes the
% paths to the recipe Working folder, as well as Originals, Rendered,
% Analysed, ConeResponse, and AllRenderings files.
